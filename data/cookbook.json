          "Add the hot pasta directly to the pan with the pancetta. Toss it in the rendered fat to coat the spaghetti.",
          "Remove the pan from the heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta. Toss well, adding reserved pasta water as needed to create a creamy sauce. The residual heat will cook the eggs, creating a silky texture.",

          "Make sure to use the pasta water to adjust the creaminess of the sauce—it should be smooth and glossy, not too dry or runny."

            What was the miracle going inside<br>
             The bubbling sensation in my tummy<br>
             Were you playing the seek following hide<br>
             Giving me smiles all the more wide
          </p>   
             
          <p>
            From being too faint to being too giant<br>
            From feeling like a bubble to feeling a twirl<br>
            Going on and on inside and giving me a chill<br>  
            Finding comfort in your own cozy well
          </p>
          
          <p>
            At times on the left and at times on the right<br>
            Sometimes below and sometimes upright<br>    
            The tummy once loose is all the more tight<br>
           With the butterflies you give me all the night
          </p>
          
          <p>
            At times you move a little less and make me worry<br>
            And at times you move a lot more to make me merry<br>
            You are the wonderful creation i sought from God<br> 
            You are my only wonder in the whole big world
          </p>
